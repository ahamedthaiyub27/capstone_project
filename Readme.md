#  Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors game â€” a fun and interactive web project built as part of my capstone for the Cuvette full stack development course.

This is a classic game with a modern, responsive UI, smooth animations, and a few neat features like ripple effects when you win. The app also remembers your score using local storage!
