# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors game — a fun and interactive web project built as part of my capstone for the Cuvette full stack development course.

This is a classic game with a modern, responsive UI, smooth animations, and a few neat features like ripple effects when you win. The app also remembers your score using local storage!

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project is made using:

- HTML
- CSS (with Flexbox and animations)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, localStorage, event handling)

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click on **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The computer makes a random choice.
3. See if you win, lose, or draw!
4. Scores are saved so you can pick up where you left off.
5. You can also view the rules or reset the game.


## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

- The ripple effect is dynamically added via JavaScript when the player wins.
- Game state is handled with conditionals and stored using `localStorage`.
- All interactions are wrapped with basic error handling to prevent crashes if something’s missing.
